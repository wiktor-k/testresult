# Security policy

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately.
Do not disclose it as a public issue.
This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis.
As such, please give us at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
We will contact you back within 2 business days after reporting the issue.

Thanks for helping make the project safe for everyone!
